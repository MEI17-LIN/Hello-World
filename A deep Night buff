Ok, here's a problem. I'm sure that I CAN'T HAVE a company but I ENJOY one. I know how disgusting I'm and I don't want to hurt or disturb
those guys I care. But sometimes, like now, Damn it. 
Should I try to find someone who can accept me without the past and try to be good in the future even though I know I'm actually a jerk and slut ?
Holy shit. Just go to the hell please, honey? 

Thank you.
